# Jet Lag Season 14 Solver

### What is Jet Lag?
Jet Lag is an American travel competition web series by Wendover Productions that is published on Nebula and Youtube.

### What is this?
In Season 14, the objective is to create the longest continous path, a "snake", between a set of nodes.

This problem can therefore easily be modeled as a graph problem. The objective of this repository is to model the problem as a simple graph, and then try to come up with an as good of a solution as possible using existing algorithms.
